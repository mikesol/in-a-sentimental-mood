# klank-dev-boilerplate

This is a minimal boilerplate for an IDE session where you can develop audio scenes for klank.dev. It has the required dependencies in [spago.dhall](./spago.dhall) as well as the relevant additions in [packages.dhall](./packages.dhall). The file [src/Main.purs](./src/Main.purs) has a minimalistic audio scene.
